BASE64 ENCODER

Noteworthy Files:
   main.go
	Source code for the programming exercise.
   ./main
	Executable for the program. No command line arguments required
   main_test.go
	Brief suite of test cases for the implemented Base64 Algorithm

Using the program:
	To compile the program run: "go build main.go". This will create an executable you can run using "./main". To execute test cases run "go test" or you can use your IDE if compatible.

About the program:
	This program runs in the command line. When executed the program prompts the user to enter text that they wish to encode into base64. Once entered and processed the console will show: the text the user entered, the base64 encoding of the text using the Go Library "encoding/base64", the base64 encoding of the text using the algorithm implemented from scratch, whether or not the two separate implementations match, and the time taken, in microseconds, for each algorithm to process the request.
